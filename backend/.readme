# Backend Build & Test Guide

## Prerequisites

* **Java JDK 11+** installed and `JAVA_HOME` set
* **Maven** installed globally OR use the Maven Wrapper included (`./mvnw` and `./mvnw.cmd`)
* Optional: IDE like **IntelliJ IDEA** for code navigation and debugging

---

## Building the Backend

Navigate to the backend folder:

```bash
cd backend
```

Then build the project:

```bash
./mvnw clean package
```

Or, if Maven is installed globally:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

This will:

* Compile the source code
* Run all tests (unit & integration)
* Package the application JAR in `backend/target/`

---

## Running the Backend Application

To start the Spring Boot application directly via Maven:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Or

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

You can also run the packaged JAR:

```bash
java -jar target/bihari-rasoi-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

---

## Running Tests

To run tests separately:

```bash
./mvnw test
```

Or

```bash
mvn test
```
---

## Troubleshooting

* **Build fails due to missing dependencies?**
  Run `./mvnw clean install -U` to force update dependencies.

* **Cannot run `./mvnw` on Windows?**
  Use `mvnw.cmd` or run via a terminal like Git Bash.
